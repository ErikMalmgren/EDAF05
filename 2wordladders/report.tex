  \section{Results}

  Parsing takes hella time, bfs supa fast.

  \section{Implementation details}

  We used BFS to find the shortest path. To build the graph, we parse input and build the graph as a adjacency matrix represented by a dict.
  The overall running time was about 7 seconds. 

  \section{Time complexity}

  The BFS time complexity is $O(n + m)$, where n is the number of nodes and m is the nodes in the node's adjacency matrix. 
  Our implementation is correct, since it visits each node exactly one time.
